## Introduction
Spigot is pretty amazing. It allows players to log on to any server and immediately have new functionality with ever installing a client-side mod. However, it has limitations. You cannot add new blocks, items, or sounds. This API aims to fix that through the use of a constructed resource pack and Optifine. This plugin was inspired by the plugin [Craftomated](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/craftomated-cables-quarries-jetpacks-electric-tools-and-more-early-alpha.15065/) by Oberdiah, the videos made by [SimplySarc](https://www.youtube.com/user/SimplySarc), and the [ItemBound](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/itembound-16x) resource pack.

## Can I Help?
[Of course](https://github.com/bsergent/GrowthAPI/wiki/How-to-Help)! If you're a programmer, you can help me fix bugs and work on new features. Please submit your pull requests to the *develop* branch. If you're good at working through problems or at least documenting them, you can report any bugs you find. If you've got plenty of money, you could donate some of it to me because college makes me poor. If you can't or don't want to help in the other ways, you could always spread the word to your friends.
